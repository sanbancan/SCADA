SCADA Repository

Welcome to the SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) repository! This space showcases my expertise in SCADA systems developed during internships at Prolific Systems and IPMS.

Overview
SCADA is a crucial aspect of industrial automation, providing real-time monitoring, control, and data acquisition capabilities. This repository highlights my contributions and knowledge in SCADA, particularly in creating ladder logic diagrams.

Internship Experiences
Prolific Systems
During my internship at Prolific Systems, I gained hands-on experience in designing and implementing SCADA systems. My responsibilities included:

Developing ladder logic diagrams for industrial automation.
Collaborating with the team to ensure seamless integration with existing systems.
Troubleshooting and optimizing SCADA processes for improved efficiency.
Industrial Project Management Solutions (IPMS)
At IPMS, I continued to enhance my SCADA skills with a focus on:

Upgrading the automation system for Ras Tanura refinery.
Debottlenecking Haradh Gas plant and Glycol plant.
Revamping the Control System at Sabic Sharque for Ethylene production.
